INTRODUCTION
build_release is designed to build a custom install image equivalent to the
installXX.iso image offered by the OpenBSD team. It uses a siteXX.tgz set
to provide the customization.

USAGE:
./build_release.pl <options> <siteXX.tgz> <path to build image>

Options:
    -a <arch>   set architecture
    -r <rel>    set release
    -s none     do not add site tarball
    -m          include man pages
    -g          include gamesXX.tgz
    -x          include X11 sets
    -c          include compiler sets
    -m          set the FTP mirror
    -o <path>   iso output directory
    -n          do not fetch files
    -v          vanilla build (no siteXX.tgz)
    
ARCHITECTURE    
At this time, the script only supports building images for amd64 and i386. In
the future, the sparc64 architecture may be supported. If the script is not
run on an OpenBSD machine, the architecture needs to be manually specified. If
the build machine is OpenBSD, not specifying an architecture results in the
script using the same architecture as the host machine. Note that amd64 builds
may be done on an i386 machine, as no cross-compiling takes place.

RELEASE
Release is expected to be in the form X.X, i.e. 4.8.

SITE FILES
The site file may be specified as an argument or built from a root path. For a
description of the site set, see the OpenBSD FAQ section 4.14. If the -s flag
is specified, it needs to point to a root directory where the site files are.
For example:
    $ ls /tmp/stage/
    .       ..      etc
If -s is not specified, the first argument must be the siteXX.tgz file.
